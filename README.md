This is a Java webapp that contains mvn pom.xml file. Simple pull the application from git,
then build/run the application from any popular IDEs.

the home page of the application is: http://localhost:8080/bodybuilding/
the result page of the application is: http://localhost:8080/bodybuilding/getProduct

The application is built based on Spring MVC and Spring Rest Template and Maven and etc...
