This is a Java webapp that contains mvn pom.xml file. Simple pull the application from git,
then build/run the application from any popular IDEs.

the home page of the application is: http://localhost:8080/bodybuilding/
the result page of the application is: http://localhost:8080/bodybuilding/getProduct

The application is built based on Spring MVC and Spring Rest Template and Maven and etc...

Due to the limited time, I am not able to finished the testing of the application. 
Although I have spent hours on the debugging. I am so sure I have setup the content type
to "application/json" before calling Spring Rest Template.

Here is the error:
Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.web.client.RestClientException: 
Could not extract response: no suitable HttpMessageConverter found for response type 
[class com.bodybuilding.dto.ProductResponse] and content type [text/plain;charset=utf-8]

Because the error, The view page is not showing correctly.

If I have time tomorrow, I will continue to work on this.

Thanks, Michelle
